/**
 * A labelled figure with an optional footer (meter, link, or caption).
 *
 * `value` is rendered here rather than passed as children so every stat in the
 * grid lands on the same 34px/bold/leading-none figure — that consistency is
 * the whole point of the row, and it was previously re-typed per card.
 * `suffix` carries the "/3" in "2/3" at a smaller size.
 *
 * Two surface treatments, both off by default so plain white stays the norm
 * (the Payments stats, for one, stay flat):
 *   `toned`  — a soft tone wash from CARD_TONE, in `tone`.
 *   `filled` — a deep per-tone fill from CARD_FILL, in `tone`, carrying white.
 * `filled` wins if both are set. Either way the hue comes from `tone`, so a
 * filled row still colour-codes each metric — just on a dark ground.
